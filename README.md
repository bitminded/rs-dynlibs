# rs-dynlibs
This project aims to provide functionality for loading dynamic libraries across different platforms (e.g. linux and windows). This is part of an ongoing personal learning experience and therefore only contains the functionality that is required for the time being. Out of these reasons pull requests won't be accepted. The use of this repository is discouraged.
